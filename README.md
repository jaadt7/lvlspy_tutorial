# lvlspy_tutorial
This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate the lvlspy [API](https://lvlspy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lvlspy.html#module-lvlspy.properties). 

# Creating XMLs
This notebook demonstrates how to create levels and transitions, add those to species, add the species to a species collection, and then how to write those data to an XML file.  You can download the notebook and run it locally, or you can run it on Google colab by clicking on the following badge: [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/jaadt7/lvlspy_tutorial/blob/master/create_xml_notebook.ipynb)

# Validation and Calculation
This notebook will allow you to read in data from lvlspy appropriate XML and perform time evolution calculations. You can download the notebook and run it locally, or you can run it on Google colab by clicking on the following badge: [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/jaadt7/lvlspy_tutorial/blob/master/validate_and_calculate.ipynb)
